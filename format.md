* Captialize both the subject line and the body
* The body can be omitted for short commit messages
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use imperative in the subject line
* Cap the subject line at 50 characters
* Explain only *what* you did and your *reasons* for doing it.  
  *The* code *explains* how *you did it.*
* In the body, use sentences and bullet points
* Separate the subject line and the body with a newline

### Solvdoku-Specific Rules

* Bullet points in the body are written with a dash ('-')
* You can use the asterisk symbol ('*') to emphasize text,  
  similar to markdown syntax
